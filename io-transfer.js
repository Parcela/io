         * Performs an AJAX DELETE request.  Shortcut for a call to [`xhr`](#method_xhr) with `method` set to  `'DELETE'`.
         *
         * The Promise gets fulfilled if the server responses with `STATUS-CODE` in the 200-range (excluded 204).
         * It will be rejected if a timeout occurs (see `options.timeout`), or if `xhr.abort()` gets invoked.
         *
         * Note: `data` should be a plain object with only primitive types which are transformed into key/value pairs.
         *
         * @method delete
         * @param url {String} URL of the resource server
         * @param deleteKey {Object} Indentification of the id that has to be deleted. Typically an object like: {id: 12}
         *                  This object will be passed as the request params.
         * @param [options] {Object}
         *    @param [options.url] {String} The url to which the request is sent.
         *    @param [options.sync=false] {boolean} By default, all requests are sent asynchronously. To send synchronous requests, set to true.
         *    @param [options.params] {Object} Data to be sent to the server.
         *    @param [options.body] {Object} The content for the request body for POST method.
         *    @param [options.headers] {Object} HTTP request headers.
         *    @param [options.timeout=3000] {Number} to timeout the request, leading into a rejected Promise.
         *    @param [options.withCredentials=false] {boolean} Whether or not to send credentials on the request.
         * @return {Promise}
         * on success:
            * xhr {XMLHttpRequest|XDomainRequest} xhr-response
         * on failure an Error object
            * reason {Error}
